What does it take to own an IP address?!

---

### Agenda:
1. Get an IP address
2. BGP registration
3. Life of a packet

---

Let us procure an IP 

--

How about 127.0.0.1?

--

Nah, that is where I stay! üè°

--

How about 192.168.1.2?

--

Nah, that is a private IP address and does not need to be procured. </br>
You can just use it internally!

--

There are a plethora of videos on youtube for Private vs Public IP and this video is not going to discuss about that! </br>

--

We should go ahead with understanding how a public IP address is procured and how anyone around the world can access it!

---

### IANA 
</br>Heard of it?
</br>What is it?

--

`The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for globally coordinating DNS Root, IP addressing, and other Internet protocol resources, including ASNs.`

--

Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), which are organizations that manage Internet number resources in a particular region of the world.
</br></br>
The five regional Internet registries are:

    African Network Information Center (AFRINIC)
    American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN)
    Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC)
    Latin American and Caribbean Network Information Centre (LACNIC)
    R√©seaux IP Europ√©ens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC)

--

What is an ASN?

--

Autonomous System Number <=> ASN

--

Let us look a little more than what it stands for!

--

`This number is used both in the exchange of exterior routing information (between neighboring Autonomous Systems) and as an identifier of the AS itself.`

--

`An AS is a group of IP networks operated by one or more network operator(s) that has a single and clearly defined external routing policy.`

--

Check out this [FAQ](https://www.apnic.net/get-ip/faqs/asn/) if you want to know more about ASNs

---

Okay, now that we know these concepts, let us look at what it takes to buy an IP

--

First requirement is to get an ASN from your RIR. **

</br></br></br></br>
<small><i>**This is not really mandatory</i></small>

--

It is as simple as having unique routing policies, filling a couple of forms and signing a few agreements.
</br>ARIN has a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HnjBbzS_jY) for you to do this.

--

Okay, I have an ASN.
</br> Now what?

--

Show some excitement and request for an IP space.
</br>ARIN has a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCm6bLPh-Pw) for this as well.

--

Let us see what it might approximately cost us ü§î

--

And finally, we have an IP address!

--

Oh, want to guess how long it might take to get an IPv4 range?
Check out [this](https://www.arin.net/resources/guide/ipv4/waiting_list/) waiting list!!!

Now is the right time to talk about BGP peering and advertisements

--

First thing is to peer our Autonomous systems with other Autonomous systems. This is done by something called BGP peering.

--

We have to peer with other AS's so that we can tell that we own a range of IPs and they will forward any traffic that comes to that IP to us.
</br> By peering, we also agree to participate in routing and help others receive their packets as well.

--

Let us look at some live examples of BGP peers [here](https://stats.apnic.net/vizas/)

--

Once you have peered with other AS's, they expect you to only advertise IP ranges that you own.

--

Since we do not own any IP/ASN at this point in time, let us assume that we have been allocated 1.1.1.0/24 (1.1.1.1 to 1.1.1.254) and our ASN is 1000

--

We have 4 web applications and we will be using the first 4 IPs for them.

--

![Image1](./BGP-IP/BGP-IP-1.png)

--

It is now time for us to make new friends and peer with them.

--

![Image2](./BGP-IP/BGP-IP-2.png)

--

We basically want our IP to be advertised/announced so that other routers know where to send the traffic coming to that IP.

--

![Image3](./BGP-IP/BGP-IP-3.png)

--

Now we are all set for anyone around the world to be able to access our applications.

--

Let us look at a simple packet flow when 3.3.3.1 wants to access the application on 1.1.1.3

Let us have a look at the realtime AS routes for redhat's website 
</br> [Click me](https://stat.ripe.net/special/bgplay#bgplay_fetch.resource=209.132.183.105)

---

The internet works on trust and the owner of an ASN needs to take utmost care not to advertise an IP he/she does not own.
Or [this](https://bgpmon.net/popular-destinations-rerouted-to-russia/) happens!! xD
